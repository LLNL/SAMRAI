    * in a state that requires tbox::Schedule to call a host-device
    * synchronize.  For example if child implmentation of this class
    * has just called a synchronize, it can return false, which tells
    * tbox::Schedule to skip the next synchronize call in its own code.
    *
    * The default implementation returns true as the safest default behavior,
    * as it will make tbox::Schedule call synchronize every time there
    * is any uncertainty about whether it is required.
