/*!
 * @brief Class StagedKernelFusers is a singleton class that serves as
 * a container of KernelFuser objects that can be executed in sequence. 
 *
 * The singleton object is accessed by the getInstance() method, and the
 * KernelFuser objects are ordered by the integer value used in the
 * getFuser() method, so that their operations can be executed in ordered
 * "stages".
 *
 * A typical usage pattern would be a loop where there is a series of
 * kernels which are dependent on each other in the sequence they appear in
 * the loop, but the kernels for each iteration are independent and
 * thus could benefit from usage of KernelFuser. This class allows kernels
 * to be fused in different KernelFuser instances while maintaining the
 * required order of execution.
 *
 *   for loop over patches
 *      staged_fusers->enqueue(0, begin, end, kernel);
 *      staged_fusers->enqueue(1, begin, end, kernel);
 *      staged_fusers->enqueue(2, begin, end, kernel);
 *   end loop
 *
 *   staged_fusers->launchAndCleanup();
 *
 * In the above pseudocode, launchAndCleanup will launch the fused kernel
 * from each stage with a synchronization and cleanup to ensure that the
 * object can be used again.
