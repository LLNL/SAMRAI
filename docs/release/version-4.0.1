                Summary of what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The old autoconf-based build system has been removed.  The new system that
uses CMake supplemented with the BLT macro library is the only supported build
system.  (This change effective as of v. 3.15.0)

                Details about what's new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) In v4.0.0 SAMRAI is introducing new features to support running applications
on GPU architectures, using capabilities provided by the Umpire and RAJA
libraries.

Umpire:  https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire
RAJA:  https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA

Umpire provides tools for memory management on multiple-memory architectures,
such as GPU architectures that use storage in both host and device memory
spaces.

RAJA provides portable abstractions for loop execution, enabling the use of
a single code base for multiple modes of running loop kernels on different
architectures, ranging from ordinary serial loop execution on a CPU, to
shared-memory multi-threading, to threaded CUDA kernel launches on a GPU.

The key feature used from Umpire is the Allocator, an object that controls
all aspects of memory allocation and will determine the location of
the allocation in architectures with multiple memory spaces.  The patch data
objects in the pdat directory have new overloaded constructors that take
an umpire::Allocator as an argument.  Additionally a new singleton class
tbox::AllocatorDatabase manages certain Allocators that are held
by SAMRAI and used to control allocations that occur internally during
SAMRAI operations.  Application codes can access these Allocators from the
AllocatorDatabase and use them to ensure that application-allocated data
and library-allocated data are allocated in the same way before they interact.
See the AllocatorDatabase documentation for more information.

RAJA is used to support a portable loop abstraction for looping over the
index spaces defined by SAMRAI's hier::Box.  The hier::parallel_for_all
and hier::for_all objects provide a way to write one code implementation
that can be used to execute the loops as threaded CUDA kernels, threaded
OpenMP kernels, or regular sequentially-incremented loops.  The execution
mode for the loops depends on the configuration of the SAMRAI installation
and the RAJA policy given to the looping structure.  See the RAJA
documentation for more information on RAJA policies.

To connect the RAJA loop structures with standard SAMRAI patch data types,
a new class ArrayView has been added to provide a way to access the data
arrays held within these types using integer (i,j,k) tuples.  The plain
integers in the tuple are used to index the loop, and they may be threaded,
so the ArrayView class is a convenient way to access the data for
thread-safe operation on the arrays.

Configuration with Umpire and RAJA is optional, so all previous functionality
using MPI parallelism is still available.


                Details about what's changed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The old autoconf-based build system has been removed.  The new system that
uses CMake supplemented with the BLT macro library was introduced in version
3.14.0 and is now the only supported build system.

The new system uses CMake (https://cmake.org) supplemented with the BLT macro
library (https://github.com/LLNL/blt).  Updated instructions for the build
system are in the INSTALL-NOTES file.

(This change effective as of v. 3.15.0)
